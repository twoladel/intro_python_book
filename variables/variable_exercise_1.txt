Exercise 1: classify following potential non-constant variable names
    index: idiomatic
    CatName: idiomatic
    lazy_dog: idiomatic
    quick_Fox: non-idiomatic because 'Fox' is capitalized. This identifier
    is a mix of snake_case and PascalCase
    1stCharacter: illegal because it starts with a digit
    operand2: idiomatic
    BIG_NUMBER: non-idiomatic because these are supposed to be non-contants,
    otherwise this would be idiomatic for contants.
    Ï€ : illegal because it is a special 1stCharacter
