Exercise 1: classify following potential non-constant variable names
    index: idiomatic
    CatName: non-idiomatic because it has capitalized letters, would be
    idiomatic if it were a class name.
    lazy_dog: idiomatic
    quick_Fox: non-idiomatic because 'Fox' is capitalized. This identifier
    is a mix of snake_case and PascalCase
    1stCharacter: illegal because it starts with a digit
    operand2: idiomatic
    BIG_NUMBER: non-idiomatic because these are supposed to be non-contants,
    otherwise this would be idiomatic for contants.
    π : non-idiomatic because π is not an ASCII character
