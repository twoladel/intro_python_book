Exercise 2: classify following potential function names

They are the same as exercise 1 because functions and variables both use
snake_case naming convention.

    1. index: idiomatic
    2. CatName: non-idiomatic because it has capitalized letters, would be
    idiomatic if it were a class name.
    3. lazy_dog: idiomatic
    4. quick_Fox: non-idiomatic because 'Fox' is capitalized. This identifier
    is a mix of snake_case and PascalCase
    5. 1stCharacter: illegal because it starts with a digit
    6. operand2: idiomatic
    7. BIG_NUMBER: non-idiomatic because these are supposed to be non-contants,
    otherwise this would be idiomatic for contants.
    8. π : non-idiomatic because π is not an ASCII character
